# The-Hungarian-Algorithm
An Implementation of the Hungarian algorithm used to solve the assignment problem

In the Assignment problem, a set of jobs and operators are given and each operatorâ€™s cost of executing each of the jobs is given. The task is to assign the jobs to the operators with minimal total cost. The Hungarian method is a combinatorial optimization algorithm used to solve this problem.

In this simulation, the user can input the number of operators and jobs to be assigned along with the cost of each assignment using a command line interface. The user can also choose whether they want to maximize or minimize the total cost of assignments. The program then calculates the ideal set of assignments and displays all steps taken in the process.

To run the program simply clone the repository and, in the command prompt, run "java (your clone location)/hungarian/UI"
